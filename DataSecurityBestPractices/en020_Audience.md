## Audience

This document addresses three critical roles in the secure deployment and management of data security in Large Language Models (LLMs):

### 1. Technical Cybersecurity Leaders

#### Roles
  Security architects, security engineers, and SOC teams
#### Focus
- Adopt defense-in-depth strategies (e.g., layered encryption, secure enclaves).
- Enforce industry-standard frameworks (NIST SP 800-53, ISO/IEC
  27001/20547/5338/38507/23894/24028/23053/22989/42001, MITRE ATLAS) and ensure compliance (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, EU AI Act, AI Action Plan).
- Implement robust monitoring (SIEM/XDR) and incident response for LLM pipelines.

### 2. Developers (Engineers & Data Scientists)

#### Roles
  ML engineers, software developers, and data scientists
#### Focus
- Integrate secure coding and data validation into CI/CD pipelines.
- Utilize artifact signing and verified model registries (e.g., MLflow) to ensure model integrity.
- Implement adversarial testing frameworks and secure data ingestion methods.

### 3. CISOs (Chief Information Security Officers)

#### Roles
  Executive leaders overseeing cybersecurity strategy and risk management
#### Focus
- Align LLM usage with organizational risk appetite and compliance mandates.
- Institutionalize zero-trust models and robust access governance.
- Foster cross-functional collaboration (Legal, Privacy, Compliance) for holistic AI security policies.
